We have two scripts for the Serial communication with the Esp process. 
1) The graphics code to display to the Esp32 when recieving the serial signal it needs. This can be customized to any graphics and we are using the ArduinoGFX graphics library for this usecase.
2) The simple AndroidApp labeled serialcomapp which sends serial signals to the esp32 upon click. This can also be further customized.
